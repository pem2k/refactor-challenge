# Horiseon SEO Landing Page Refactor

# description
This is a landing page for Horiseon Marketing. HTML and CSS have been updated to use semantic tags, anchor links have been fixed, alt text has been added to every image, and HTML and CSS follow a logical structure.  

I made these changes to increase accessibility. A marketing company with a website that's inaccessible to screen-readers shows potential clients that Horiseon is already missing potential markets.
